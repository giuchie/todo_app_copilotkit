Above is the project i want to build.
How should i structure my project files? 
(try to create as few files as possible)
Think step by step.

Help me adding details to the original PRD that give clear alignment to developers who will implement the project;

- don't create actual code, just the PRD
- including file structure into the doc
- including all documentations provided (with both example code & responses, those are important context)
